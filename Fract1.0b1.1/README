Fract1.0 (beta1.x)

Note: This is not the fastest fractal view. But for getting relly high res, high color fractal screenshots this is one of the best around. I spend a lot of time getting the color palette code to work right.  

Ok, This is a port of my old OpenGL fractal program that I wrote a while back. See the one that comes with Be is just not up to the task of realy finding kewl fract pix.  They (in my opinon) didn't spend a lot of time on the depth and the pallete. Thats what makes good fract programs. So I am proting my code over. Its prity fast and looks good. I am thinking of takeing advantage of a few Be things. Threads for example, the Mandelbrot set is highly threadable (a thread for each pixel would do it). Also I have seen int64 in there some place. This would increase the depth by Alot. So we will se what I have time for.  

I didn't use any of the Be code if you were wandering.

Ver 1.0 beta 1.1:
	Got the Drawer up and running.
	Mouse click zooms (sorta)
	Still have that problem with mouse zoom is a little off. Zoom to wrong place
	No options to change anything right now.
	Will have to port over my options menu.
	NO threading in there right now.
	We might be able to make it look nicer if we draw to a bitmap and blit.
	Realy need to make a drawer thread.. uh thats ugly right now.
Ver 1.0 Beta 1.0:
	Got most of the GUI set up .. 
	Tossing around the Multi-Threaded Idea.
	Thinking how I want to improve on this.
	Mabey we could use int64 ... hmmm
